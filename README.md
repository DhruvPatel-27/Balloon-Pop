This is a game created Python called Balloon Pop.

"Click" on the balloon to pop the balloon.

You advance to the next level by popping 3 balloons, as long as you do so before the timer runs out and before you lose all your lives. The timer resets once you progess to the next level. In the game you start with 3 lives.
